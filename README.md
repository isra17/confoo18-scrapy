# Confoo.ca Spider

Supporting my talk at Confoo "[Extracting data from the Internet with Scrapy](http://confoo.isra17.xyz)".

## Installation

Simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your virtualenv.

## Usage

To run the spider: `scrapy crawl confoo`. You can then check the data with `sqlite3 confs.db`. A Jupyter notebook is available under `notebooks/` with some example of data drilling.
